# About

Resource service is a simple microservice with purpose to provide a rudimentary CRUD API to PERSON database, which is used to hold the following data in each record:

```
   "id": Long, 
   "first_name": String, 
   "last_name": String, 
   "age": Integer,
   "favourite_color": String
```


Main features:

 - built on the basis of Spring Boot 2.4.x with extensive use of Reactive Programming patterns (in this project I am using Spring WebFlux)

 - a persistence layer is built on Reactive H2 In-Memory database  

 - contains fine grade access security on the basis of Spring Security

Here are the reasons behind my choice of technologies:

Spring WebFlux is a reactive web framework based on a reactive HTTP layer; such apps can be deployed on Netty or Undertow 
(with native adapters) or Jetty/Tomcat/any Servlet 3.1 (In this implementation I am using Netty). 
Reactive approach can be beneficial for efficiency and scalability for workloads dealing with lots of latency and concurrency. 
In other words reactive approach allows to create responsive, resilient, elastic and message-driven systems. 

Spring's reactive concepts have been taken as is from Java 8's Reactor Core library, which implements the reactive programming paradigm. 
Reactor Core in its turn is built on top of Reactive Streams Specification, which is the industry standard for building 
reactive applications in the Java world. 
Finally, all these technologies have been refined and collected under the hood of Spring WebFlux.

Spring WebFlux is an ideal choice if application deals with streams of data (input and output), and is a part of some 
bigger system where reliability and performance of each component matters (being asynchronous system can deal with latencies and be more scalable)

As for security, fine-grained authorization from Spring Security's modules allows to secure the business tier through 
method annotation and the use of interface-based proxies to accomplish AOP. For demonstration purposes 
I added default user with username=user and password=123 which has two roles – `DB_USER` and `DB_ADMIN`

In real production system makes sense to use industry-standard oauth2 authorization flow, and implement centralized 
authorization through separate oauth2 servers (f.e. those on the basis OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 API)

# API overview

Back-end has two different end-points, `` /api/persons`` and  ``/api/persons/{personId}``
Currently five methods are supported with the following signature:

| Verb   | Endpoint                |
|--------|-------------------------|
| GET    | /api/persons            |
| GET    | /api/persons/{personId} |
| POST   | /api/persons            |
| PUT    | /api/persons            |
| DELETE | /api/persons/{personId} |


Full API Documentation for back-end server's API is available on http://localhost:9090/api/documentation/swagger-ui/ 

Swagger UI works in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.

# Installation

## Dockerized build (needs docker to be installed first)

1) The following command builds image with tag resource-service:1.0. Note the dot at the end of the command. This command must be run from the root directory.

```shell
sudo docker build -t resource-service:1.0 .
```

2) The next command instantiates and expose service at localhost:9090:

```shell
sudo docker run -p 9090:9090 resource-service:1.0
```


## Local build
In order to build and run both back-end the following prerequisites are needed:

[JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net/)

[Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/download)

Run from the project's root directory:
```shell
mvn clean package 
```


<br/>

Run server as follows:

```shell
java -jar resource-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Server will start on localhost:9090 address. One can point browser to http://localhost:9090/api/documentation/swagger-ui/ to see API documentation

On first request server will ask to authorize: use the following username/password pair:

Username: user

Password: 123

# Testing

There are several integration tests written for web and business layers. I used the most popular testing frameworks 
in the Java ecosystem - JUnit 5 and Mockito, plus out-of-the-box functionality proposed by Spring Boot.

One can test endpoints manually, fe. using curl:

```shell
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9090/api/persons" --user user:123 -H "accept: */*"
```
